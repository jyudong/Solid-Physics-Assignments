\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {1}(12.3)\textbf  {Crystal Structure} \\ The diagram of Fig. 12.22 shows a plan viem of a structure of cubic ZnS (zincblende) looking down the $z$ axis. The numbers attached to some atoms represent the heights of the atoms above the $z = 0$ plane expressed as a fraction of the cube edge $a$. UNlabeled atoms are $z = 0$ and $z = 0$. \\ (a) What is the Bravais lattice type? \\ (b) Describe the basis. \\ (c) Given that $a = 0.541nm$, calculate the nearest-neighbor Zn-Zn, Zn-S and S-S distances. \\ \includegraphics [scale = 0.19]{12.3.jpeg}}{1}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {2}(12.4)\textbf  {Packing Fractions} \\ Consider a lattice with a sphere at each lattice point. Choose the radius of the spheres to be such that neighboring spheres just touch (see fir example, Fig. 12.18). The packing fraction is the fraction of the volume of all of space which is enclosed by the union of all the spheres (i.e., the ratio of the volume of the spheres to the total volume). \\ (a) Calculate the packing fraction for a simple cubic lattice. \\ (b) Calculate the packing fraction for a bcc lattice. \\ (c) Calculate the packing fraction for a fcc lattice.}{2}\protected@file@percent }
