\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {2}\textbf  {(10.5) Triatomic Chain} \\ Consider a mass-and-spring model with three different masses and three different springs per unit cell as shown in this diagram. \\ \begin  {centering} \includegraphics [scale = 0.13]{10.5.jpeg} \end  {centering} \\ As usual, assume that the masses move only in one dimension. \\ (a) At $k=0$ how many optical modes are there? Calculate the energies of these modes. Hind: you will get a cubic equation. However, you already know one of the roots since it is the energy of the acoustic mode at $k = 0$. \\ (b) If all the masses are the same and $\kappa _1 = \kappa _2$ determine the frequencies of all three modes at the zone boundary $k = \pi /a$. You will have a cubic equation, but you should be able to guess one root which corresponds to a particularly simple normal mode. \\ (c) If all three spring constants are the same, and $m_1 = m_2$ determine the frequencies of all three modes at the zone boundary $k=\pi /a$. Again you should be able to guess one of the roots. }{4}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {3}\textbf  {(11.2) Diatomic Tight Binding Chain} \\ We now generalize the calculation of the previous exercise to a one-dimensional diatomic solid which might look as follows: \[ -A-B-A-B-A-B- \] Suppose that the onsite energy of type $A$ is different from the onsite energy of type $B$. I.e., $\mathinner {\langle {n}|}H\mathinner {|{n}\rangle }$ is $\epsilon _A$ for $n$ being on a site of type $A$ and is $\epsilon _B$ for $n$ being on a site of type $B$. (All hopping matrix elements $-t$ are still identical to each other.) \\ $\triangleright $ Calculate the new dispersion relation. (This is extremely similar to Exercise 10.1. If you are stuck, try studying that exercise again.) \\ $\triangleright $ Sketch this dispersion relation in both the reduced and extended zone schemes. \\ $\triangleright $ What happens if $\epsilon _A = \epsilon _B$? \\ $\triangleright $ What happens in the "atomic" limit when $t$ become very small. \\ $\triangleright $ What is the effective mass of an electron near the bottom of the lower band? \\ $\triangleright $ If each atom (of either type) is monovalent, is the system a metal or an insulator? \\ $\triangleright $ Given the results of this exercise, explain why LiF (which has very ionic bonds) is an extremely good insulator. }{6}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {4}\textbf  {(11.4)} \\ (a) Consider an atom with two orbitals, $A$ and $B$ having eigenenergies $\epsilon _{atomic}^A$ and $\epsilon _{atomic}^B$. Now suppose we make a one-dimensional chain of such atoms and let us assume that these orbitals remain orthogonal. We imagine hopping amplitudes $t_{AA}$ which allows an electron on orbital $A$ of a given atom to hop to orbital $A$ on the neighboring atom. Similarly we imagine a hopping amplitude $t_{BB}$ that allows an electron on orbital $B$ of a given atom to hop to orbital $B$ on the neighboring atom. (We assume that $V_0$, the energy shift of the atomic orbital due to neighboring atoms, is zero). \\ $\triangleright $ Calculate and sketch the dispersion of the two resulting bands. \\ $\triangleright $ If the atom is diatomic, derive a condition on the quantities $\epsilon _{atomic}^A - \epsilon _{atomic}^B$, as well as $t_{AA}$ and $t_{BB}$ which determines whether the system is a metal or an insulator. \\ (b) Now suppose that there is in addition a hopping term $t_{AB}$ which allows an electron in one atom in orbital $A$ to hop to orbital $B$ on the neighboring atom (and vice verse). What is the dispersion relation now? }{9}\protected@file@percent }
\@writefile{toc}{\contentsline {section}{\numberline {5}\textbf  {(11.5)} Electronic Impurity State \\ Consider the one-dimensional tight binding Hamiltonian given in Eq. 11.4. Now consider the situation where one of the atoms in the chain (atom $n=0$) is an impurity such that it has an atomic orbital energy which differs by $\Delta $ from all the other atomic orbital energies. In this case the Hamiltonian becomes \[ H_{n,m} = \epsilon _0\delta _{n,m} - t(\delta _{n+1,m} + \delta _{n-1,m}) + \Delta \delta _{n,m}\delta _{n,0}. \] (a) Using an ansatz \[ \phi _n = Ae^{-qa\vert n \vert } \] with $q$ real, and $a$ the lattice constant, show that there is a localized eigenstate for any negative $\Delta $, and find the eigenstate energy. This exercise is very similar to Exercise 9.6. \\ (b) Consider instead a continuum one-dimensional Hamiltonian with a delta-function potential \[ H = -\frac  {{\mathchar "AF\mkern -9muh}^2}{2m^*}\partial _x^2 + (a\Delta )\delta (x). \] Similarly show that there is a localized eigenstate for any negative $\Delta $ and find its energy. Compare your result to that of part (a). }{11}\protected@file@percent }
